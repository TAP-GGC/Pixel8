## Sharing the Workshop with Your Classroom

<p align="center">
At the time of this document's creation, there is unfortunately no way to share custom .sb3 files or CS First Playground Projects to a Google Classroom through CS First. 
</p>
<p align="center">
Here are a few alternative methods suggested by the CS First Customer Support Team for sharing the workshop with your class.
</p>

### Option 1: Sharing the file via Google Drive

If you have a Google Drive/OneDrive account that is accessible to your classroom, you can take the downloaded [.sb3](https://github.com/TAP-GGC/NinjaTurtles/blob/main/Code/Complete%20Code%20for%20the%20Game.sb3) file and upload it somewhere that your students can easily access it.

Once they’ve downloaded the file, they can follow the same steps taken in Step 2 of the [Accessing the Workshop File](#step-2-uploading-to-cs-first) segment of this document. 

### Option 2: Sharing the File via Flash Drive

<b>The</b> <a href="https://github.com/TAP-GGC/NinjaTurtles/blob/main/Code/Complete%20Code%20for%20the%20Game.sb3">.sb3</a> <b>file will have to be downloaded onto a flash drive and uploaded to EVERY individual computer.</b>

* Upload the file to each student's individual computer using the flash drive. 

* Open up Documents, Go to the Downloads folder, and Drag and drop the file from the flash drive folder into your students downloads folder

### Option 3: Contact IT/Administration

If you don’t have permission to use Google Drive/OneDrive to share the file or don’t have access to a flash drive, you can contact your school’s administration or IT office to see if the .sb3 file can be uploaded remotely to your classroom's computers.
