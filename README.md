## About
Pixel Arcade is a 2D interactive game built with Unity with the purpose of teaching binary to students ranging from middle school to college. Unity uses C# for programming games in 3D, 2D, or even AR and VR. Pixel Arcade has two games that were used for teaching and one extra game that was more creative and fun that students could play after they learned the basics. The project provides students with the opportunity to develop an interest in the technology field through engaging with educational games. According to the surveys, games were found to be an effective method of teaching technology concepts such as binary.
<!-- You can look at other TAP projects if you need a better idea of how to describe your workshop objectives -->

Four workshops were conducted. Two workshops were online while the other two were in-person. The workshops allowed students to play the different games while testing their knowledge of binary. 
A short presentation was given before the students played which included: introducing the group and TAP, teaching students what binary is and how to convert from decimal to binary and vice versa. 
Afterwards, participants got the chance to play the game and enforce what they just learned. There were tips and tricks provided in each game to help further enhance the concepts.

## Project Information
<!-- 
Your Options for Target Audience: 
  - High School
  - College
  - Middle School
  - K-12
  - Non-Stem
  - Undergraduate
You can select from a range of audiences or a single audience. Examples: 
    Middle School - College 
    High School - College
    K-12
  You will be presenting most often to your peers who are taking introductory technology classes, so more often than not you should be including college in your target audience range.

## Project Description
<b>Pixel Arcade</b> is an interactive 2D game that will instruct students about the basics of binary. It was built using Unity and C#. Binary is the basis of how computers, photo editing, RGB, audio, and many other technologies work, which is why we wanted to get students familiar with it early on. Participants will play a tutorial and then 3 mini-games.

</p>
<b>Binary Maze</b> – A 3-level game where the user goes through a maze and must answer all the questions before moving on to the next level.

* The 1st level will go over a base power of 2
* The 2nd level will go over 4-bit
* The 3rd level will go over 8-bit.

</p>
<b>Planet 01000010</b> – A game where the users will answer questions about binary with varying difficulty to see if they can beat the NPC at traversing the board and get back home.

</p>
<b>RGB Paint</b> – A game where the user will plug in some numbers for the RGB chart which will then produce a random color for them to draw with on their canvas. This will be played after the participant has played either one of the other games.

## Technology
<p align="center">
<img alt="" src = "https://github.com/TAP-GGC/Pixel8/blob/main/media/technology/Unity-Logo.png" width="200" height="100">

</p>
The project is built with Unity as the main technology. Unity is a popular cross-platform game engine used for developing 2D, 3D, AR, VR, and simulation-based projects. This technology was used to build an interactive 2D game that instruct participants about the basics of binary conversions and decimal conversions.  The game was posted online on itch.io so participants could play straight from the web which allows for easier access to the game for both our in-person and online participants.
</p>

</p>
Unity is a powerful game engine that makes it easy for developers to get a game up and running very quickly and smoothly. One of our team members already had prior knowledge of unity which made it a great option. C#, which is the programming language that unity uses, is also similar to java which is taught at GGC. We originally were going to make the game 3D which is another reason why we chose Unity. But ultimately, unity had more resources available for people learning how to use the game engine such as assets, videos, and documentation.
