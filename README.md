## About
Pixel Arcade is a 2D interactive game built with Unity with the purpose of teaching binary to students ranging from middle school to college. Unity uses C# for programming games in 3D, 2D, or even AR and VR. Pixel Arcade has two games that were used for teaching and one extra game that was more creative and fun that students could play after they learned the basics. The project provides students with the opportunity to develop an interest in the technology field through engaging with educational games. According to the surveys, games were found to be an effective method of teaching technology concepts such as binary.
<!-- You can look at other TAP projects if you need a better idea of how to describe your workshop objectives -->

Four workshops were conducted. Two workshops were online while the other two were in-person. The workshops allowed students to play the different games while testing their knowledge of binary. 
A short presentation was given before the students played which included: introducing the group and TAP, teaching students what binary is and how to convert from decimal to binary and vice versa. 
Afterward, participants got the chance to play the game and enforce what they just learned. There were tips and tricks provided in each game to help further enhance the concepts.

## Project Description 
<b>Pixel Arcade</b> is a collection of interactive 2D games that will instruct students about the basics of binary. It was built using Unity and C#. Binary is the basis of how computers, photo editing, RGB, audio, and many other technologies work, which is why we wanted to get students familiar with it early on. Participants will play a tutorial and then 3 mini-games.

</p>
<b>Binary Maze</b> – A 3-level game where the user goes through a maze and must answer all the questions before moving on to the next level.

* The 1st level will go over a base power of 2
* The 2nd level will go over 4-bit
* The 3rd level will go over 8-bit.

<b>Planet 01000010</b> – A game where the users will answer questions about binary with varying difficulty to see if they can beat the NPC at traversing the board and get back home.

<b>RGB Paint</b> – A game where the user will plug in some numbers for the RGB chart which will then produce a random color for them to draw with on their canvas. This will be played after the participant has played either one of the other games.

The project is built with Unity as the main technology. Unity is a popular cross-platform game engine used for developing 2D, 3D, AR, VR, and simulation-based projects. This technology was used to build an interactive 2D game that instruct participants about the basics of binary conversions and decimal conversions.  The game was posted online on itch.io so participants could play straight from the web which allows for easier access to the game for both our in-person and online participants.
</p>

</p>
Unity is a powerful game engine that makes it easy for developers to get a game up and running very quickly and smoothly. One of our team members already had prior knowledge of unity which made it a great option. C#, which is the programming language that unity uses, is also similar to Java which is taught at GGC. We originally were going to make the game 3D which is another reason why we chose Unity. But ultimately, unity had more resources available for people learning how to use the game engine such as assets, videos, and documentation.

## Project Usage
<i>Instructions for playing each game are provided within the game itself by utilizing the help buttons~!</i>

* <b>Tutorial:</b> There are three question types that are shown within the tutorial that mimic questions that will be asked in the games. Attempt to answer them! If a user gets stuck, press the help button and it will provide guidance. If a user ever gets a question wrong, a pop-up will appear that displays a hint for the user. Multiple hints are provided for people who need extra guidance! Once all three questions are answered correctly, click the exit button to enter the main menu!

* <b>Binary Maze:</b> There are three seperate levels for this game. The objective is to answer all the questions for each level while staying under 12 minutes for each level.
  * 1st level: Users must go through the maze to find and answer all 10 questions on the base power of 2 questions. There is a minimap that can be toggled. There is also a help button that pauses the in game timer and provides further guidance. A level complete screen will pop up when users have correctly answered all questions and it will display the time it took to answer the questions on that level.
  * 2nd level: Users must go through the maze to find and answer all 10 questions on binary conversion and decimal conversion using 4-bits. There is a minimap that can be toggeled. There is also a help button that pauses the in game timer and provides further guidance. A level complete screen will pop up when users have correctly answered all questions and it will display the time it took to answer the questions on that level.
  * 3rd level: Users must go through the maze to find and answer all 10 questions on binary conversion and decimal conversion using 8-bits. There is a minimap that can be toggled. There is also a help button that pauses the in-game timer and provides further guidance. A level complete screen will pop up when users have correctly answered all questions and it will display the time it took to answer the questions on that level.

* <b>Planet Binary:</b> Users are competing against an NPC(non-playable character), to answer all the questions and make it to the end of the board game. The questions include conceptual binary questions, conversions from binary to decimal and from decimal to binary using 4-bits and 8-bits, and lastly the base power of 2 questions. Users will roll the dice to determine how many spaces they can move if they get the answer correct. Then they can answer the question and see if they are allowed to move. The game ends when either the player or the NPC answers all the questions and reaches the end. 

* <b>RGB Paint:</b> This game is an explorative, creative game that allows users to visually see how binary changes RGB colors.
