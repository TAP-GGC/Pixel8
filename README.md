## :loudspeaker: About
Our project allows students to develop an interest in the technology field through engaging with educational games involving the conversion between binary and decimal. 
<!-- You can look at other TAP projects if you need a better idea of how to describe your workshop objectives -->

This workshop will have students play an interactive game that will allow students to go through different games that will test their knowledge of binary and decimal conversions. 
This workshop will give a short presentation explaining TAP, binary coding, and the project. After that,  participants will get the chance to play the game and enforce what they just learned. There will be tips and tricks included in each game to help further enhance the concept.

## :page_with_curl: Project Description
Our project provides students with the opportunity to develop an interest in the technology field through engaging with educational games involving the conversion between binary and decimal. There will be 3 different mini-games they will able to interact with.  <br><br>

<img alt="" src = "https://github.com/TAP-GGC/Pixel8/blob/main/media/logos/Binary_Maze_Light_Mode-removebg-preview.png"  height="120"> Binary Maze â€“ A game where the user will go through a maze where they will have to answer all the questions before moving on to the next level. There are 3 levels to the game. The 1st level will go over a base power of 2, 2nd level will go over 4-bit, and the last level will go over 8-bit. <br>

<img alt="" src = "https://github.com/TAP-GGC/Pixel8/blob/main/media/logos/Planet%2001000010%20Transparent.png"  height="120"> Planet 01000010 â€“ A game where the user will roll dice and will have to answer the question to move that number of spaces. (Can you help the alien find its way home?) <br>

<img alt="" src = "https://github.com/TAP-GGC/Pixel8/blob/main/media/logos/RGB%20Paint%20Transparent.png"  height="120"> RGB Paint â€“ A game where the user will plug in some numbers for the RGB chart which will then produce a random color for them to draw with on their canvas.Â This will be played after the participant has played either one of the other games.

## :computer: Technology

* The project is built with Unity as the main technology. Unity is a popular cross-platform game engine used for developing 2D, 3D, AR, VR, and simulation-based projects. This technology will be used to build an interactive 2D game that will instruct participants about the basics of binary conversions and decimal conversions.  We plan to post the game online so the participants can play straight from the web which allows for easier access to the game for both our in-person and online participants.
