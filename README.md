## About
Our project provides students with the opportunity to develop an interest in the technology field through engaging with educational games involving the teaching of binary.
<!-- You can look at other TAP projects if you need a better idea of how to describe your workshop objectives -->

This workshop will have students play an interactive game that will allow students to go through different games that will test their knowledge of binary. 
This workshop will give a short presentation explaining TAP, binary coding, and the project. 
After that,  participants will get the chance to play the game and enforce what they just learned. There will be tips and tricks included in each game to help further enhance the concept.

## Project Information
<!-- 
Your Options for Target Audience: 
  - High School
  - College
  - Middle School

## Project Description
<b>Pixel Arcade</b> is an interactive 2D game that will instruct students about the basics of binary and was built using Unity. Binary is the basis of how computers, photo editing, RGB, audio, and many other technologies work, which is why we wanted to get students familiar with it early on. Participants will play a tutorial and then 3 mini-games.

</p>
<b>Binary Maze</b> – A 3-level game where the user goes through a maze and must answer all the questions before moving on to the next level.

* The 1st level will go over a base power of 2
* The 2nd level will go over 4-bit
* The 3rd level will go over 8-bit.

</p>
<b>Planet 01000010</b> – A game where the users will answer questions about binary with varying difficulty to see if they can beat the NPC at traversing the board and get back home.

</p>
<b>RGB Paint</b> – A game where the user will plug in some numbers for the RGB chart which will then produce a random color for them to draw with on their canvas. This will be played after the participant has played either one of the other games.

## Technology

</p>
The project is built with Unity as the main technology. Unity is a popular cross-platform game engine used for developing 2D, 3D, AR, VR, and simulation-based projects. This technology will be used to build an interactive 2D game that will instruct participants about the basics of binary conversions and decimal conversions.  We plan to post the game online so the participants can play straight from the web which allows for easier access to the game for both our in-person and online participants.
