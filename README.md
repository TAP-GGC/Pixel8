## :loudspeaker: About
The objective of this project is to teach students about all things binary-related such as converting binary to decimal, reading and writing RGB, and teaching about hex code.
<!-- You can look at other TAP projects if you need a better idea of how to describe your workshop objectives -->

This workshop will have students play an interactive game that will allow students to go through a maze to collect pieces for a puzzle by answering binary questions through input, buttons, etc. The goal of the game to collect all the pieces to get the correct puzzle.

## :page_with_curl: Project Description
The objective of this project is to teach students about binary-related topics, such as converting binary to decimal, reading and writing RGB values, and understanding hex codes. The workshop will feature an interactive game in which students navigate through a maze to collect puzzle pieces by answering binary-related questions through inputs, buttons, and other interactive elements. Players will face challenges of increasing difficulty as they progress, reinforcing their understanding of binary concepts. Along the way, hints and explanations will be provided to help students grasp more complex ideas and complete the puzzle correctly.
